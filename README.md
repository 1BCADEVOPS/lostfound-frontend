**Project Summary**

The Lost and Found Management System is a full-stack web application developed to help users report, manage, and retrieve lost or found items efficiently. The system allows users to submit item details through a user-friendly frontend interface, which are then securely processed and stored by the backend server.

The frontend of the application is developed using React.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface for users to add and view lost or found items. All frontend-backend communication is handled through RESTful APIs.

The backend is built using Spring Boot, which handles business logic, API requests, and database operations. It exposes REST APIs for creating, retrieving, and managing lost and found item data. The backend ensures reliable data handling and server-side processing.

To make the application production-ready, the backend is containerized using Docker and deployed on Render, ensuring portability and scalability. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, enabling continuous deployment directly from GitHub.

Environment variables are used to securely connect the frontend to the deployed backend, ensuring flexibility between development and production environments. The application successfully demonstrates full-stack development, REST API integration, Docker-based backend deployment, and cloud hosting.

This project fulfills real-world application requirements and showcases practical knowledge of frontend development, backend development, deployment, and DevOps concepts.
